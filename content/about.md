I write bioinformatics software at Oregon Health and Science Univeristy. I am passionate about building and contributing to open source software for biology research and data analysis.

I specialize in the development of reproducible data pipelines, and my favorite tool for doing so is [Snakemake](https://snakemake.readthedocs.io/en/stable/).

Some projects I have worked on: 


- [gopeaks](https://github.com/maxsonBraunLab/gopeaks): calling peaks from CUT&TAG sequencing data
- [karyopype](https://github.com/jakevc/karyopype): a chromosomal visualization python API
- [grayle](https://app.grayle.co/user/explore): a shoe recommendation app


In my spare time I enjoy knitting, cycling, and tennis.
