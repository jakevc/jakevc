I work as Bioinformatics Analyst on genomics and epigenetics projects in the [Carbone lab](http://carbonelab.com/?page_id=88) at Oregon Health and Science Univeristy.

I am passionate about building and contributing to open source bioinformatics software. I specialize in the development of reproducible data pipelines, and my favorite tool for doing so is [Snakemake](https://snakemake.readthedocs.io/en/stable/).

Before joining the Carbone lab I worked in genomics support core at the Stowers Institute for Medical Research with [Chris Seidel](https://research.stowers.org/cws/). There I worked on the genomics of the blind cave fish (*Astyanax mexicanus*).

During the completion of my Master's degree I studied the Ugandan red colobus genome (*Piliocolobus rufomitratus*). I developped a pipeline to mine miRNAs from genomic DNA, with the goal of observing the role of these miRNAs in the inflammatory state of Simmian Immunodeficiency Virus (SIV). This work was carried out in collaboration with the [Molecular Anthropology Group](http://molecular-anthro.uoregon.edu/) at the University of Oregon.

I earned a B.S. in Chemistry from the University of Portland in May of 2017.  

In my spare time I enjoy knitting, cycling, and working on my car.
