I work as a bioinformatics researcher in the genomics core at the Stowers Institute for Medical Research. I am passionate about applying computational tools to biological questions. I am interested in providing reproducible solutions to biological data analysis, for example: I like to use well-maintained workflow management systems such as [Snakemake](https://snakemake.readthedocs.io/en/stable/), and git for version control.

I am currently working on genomic investigation of three populations of *Astyanax mexicanus* with strikingly different morphologies. This work is being carried out in support of the primary investigator [Nicolas Rohner](https://www.stowers.org/faculty/rohner-lab).

I have previously done work on the Ugandan red colobus genome (*Piliocolobus rufomitratus*). I was responsible for developping a pipeline to mine miRNAs from genomic DNA, with the goal of observing the role of these miRNAs in the inflammatory state of Simmian Immunodeficiency Virus (SIV). This work was carried out in collaboration with the [Molecular Anthropology Group](http://molecular-anthro.uoregon.edu/) at the University of Oregon.

I earned my B.S. in Biochemistry from the University of Portland in May of 2017. There I studied the role of polyphenolic natural products in enzyme degredation. Specifically, I studied the inhibition of the enzyme hyaluronidase by plant extracts and the potential for this inhibition to repair neurodegenerative disease. Dr. Angela Hoffman was my mentor for this work.

My other hobbies include knitting, outdoor rock climbing, and cycling.
