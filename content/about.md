I am a Bioinformatics Analyst working on evolutionary genomics and epigenetics projects in the [Carbone lab](http://carbonelab.com/?page_id=88). I am passionate about contributing to open source bioinformatics software and performing computational analyses that answer biological questions. For example I have experience creating analysis pipelines using [Snakemake](https://snakemake.readthedocs.io/en/stable/) leading to reproducible, well-documented downstream analyses. 

Before joining the Carbone lab I worked in Genomics at the Stowers Institute for Medical Research with [Chris Seidel](https://research.stowers.org/cws/) where I worked primarily on the genomics of the blind cave fish (*Astyanax mexicanus*). During the completion of my Master's degree I studied the Ugandan red colobus genome (*Piliocolobus rufomitratus*). I developped a pipeline to mine miRNAs from genomic DNA, with the goal of observing the role of these miRNAs in the inflammatory state of Simmian Immunodeficiency Virus (SIV). This work was carried out in collaboration with the [Molecular Anthropology Group](http://molecular-anthro.uoregon.edu/) at the University of Oregon.

I earned my B.S. in Biochemistry from the University of Portland in May of 2017. There I studied the role of polyphenolic natural products in enzyme degradation. Specifically, I studied the inhibition of the enzyme hyaluronidase by plant extracts and the potential for this inhibition to repair neurodegenerative disease. Dr. Angela Hoffman was my mentor for this work.

In my spare time I enjoy knitting, cycling, and working on my car.
