I am a Bioinformatics Research Associate working at the forefront of evolutionary genomics and epigenetics in the [Carbone lab](). I am passionate about reproducible computational analyses that answer biological questions. For example, I have experience creating workflows in [Snakemake](https://snakemake.readthedocs.io/en/stable/) and using git for version control leading to robust and well-documented downstream analyses. 

Before joining the Carbone lab I worked in the Genomics core at the Stowers Institute for Medical Research. 
During the completion of my Master's degree I studied the Ugandan red colobus genome (*Piliocolobus rufomitratus*). I was responsible for developing a pipeline to mine miRNAs from genomic DNA, with the goal of observing the role of these miRNAs in the inflammatory state of Simmian Immunodeficiency Virus (SIV). This work was carried out in collaboration with the [Molecular Anthropology Group](http://molecular-anthro.uoregon.edu/) at the University of Oregon.

I earned my B.S. in Biochemistry from the University of Portland in May of 2017. There I studied the role of polyphenolic natural products in enzyme degradation. Specifically, I studied the inhibition of the enzyme hyaluronidase by plant extracts and the potential for this inhibition to repair neurodegenerative disease. Dr. Angela Hoffman was my mentor for this work.

In my spare time I enjoy knitting, working on my car, outdoor rock climbing, and cycling.
