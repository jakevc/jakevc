      <description>Rstudio server slurm I have been spoiled at my current workplace. We have Rstudio server running on our shared servers with access to lots of CPUs and enough memory to say the least, but I may not always find myself in this situation. When I was first learning R I was running Rstudio locally, but I wasn&amp;rsquo;t working with massive genomic datasets then, and required fewer CPUs and much less memory.</description>
