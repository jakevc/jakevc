      <description>Creating Slides in Golang I am about to give a journal club presentation on a recent epigenetics paper. I have also been learning golang. Many learning materials, and golang presentations I run into are very clean html presentations with absolutely no bells and whistles, that appear to run in the browser.
I soon found out these presentations are generated from the &amp;lsquo;present&amp;rsquo; package, which is a built in golang tool at golang.</description>
