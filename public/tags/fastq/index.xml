      <description>The command line tool historically used to download public bioinformatics data from the Sequencing Read Archive (SRA) is fastq-dump. Fastq-dump was awesome when it was developed, until bioinformatics workflows became more parallelized across much larger datasets. Today, the SRA holds just over 5 PB of open access data, and the growth is rapid.
I was recently testing a pipeline on some public data. As I download fastq files from SRA using fastq-dump, it didn&amp;rsquo;t take long before I was getting impatient.</description>
